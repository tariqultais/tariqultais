- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ...
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ...
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: ...
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: ...

My name is Tariqul. I've been using GitHub to host my repos for many years. And I always feel like it doesn't provide me with the full picture statistics-wise.

ðŸ¤” Feeling the same? ðŸš€ Try [Å¸ HÅ¸PE] to learn what's going on with your professional profile!
You'll get improved statistics on your profile views, your followers and more!
The roadmap has a number of useful features to come!

In case you would simply like a public badge to count your visitors, try [GitHub Profile Views Counter].
